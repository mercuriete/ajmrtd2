    <string name="infotext_a1">No, thats not possible. You have to prove that you hold the Passport in hand, by sending the Passport No. and two dates written on the Passport. These data are known as BAC-Keys (Basic Access Control). ajmrtd allows you to store and manage different BAC-Keys for convenience.</string>
